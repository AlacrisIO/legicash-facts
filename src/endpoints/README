Using ocsigen and eliom requires some additional OPAM packages:

  ocsigenserver eliom ppx_deriving_yojson

On Ubuntu systems, it may be necessary to install libgdbm-dev and libpcre3-dev.

This directory was created by running

  eliom-distillery -name endpoints -template basic.ppx

The file Makefile.options was edited to add packages needed to build the code,
and the generated file endpoints.eliom, which contained boilerplate, was edited to
get the endpoints we wanted to define. The Makefile was then edited severely, 
and endpoints.eliom was renamed to endpoints.ml. Other .ml files were added later.
The .ml files are compiled via dune.

To run the ocsigen server locally, run:

  make endpoints

from the legicash-fact git root. That command starts a local server on port 8081.
Alternatively, if the Legicash library has been built already, from the directory
Where this README is located, you can run:

  make run.test
