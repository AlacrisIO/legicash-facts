       branches from node [i] at specified [height], given results [cleft] and

     - [skipk ~i ~height ~depth ~childi ~childres ~k]: Result from recursing
       down [depth] skipped children of node [i], given that the result from
       extant child of the skipped nodes, at index ~childi, is [childres].

     - [leafk ~i ~valuea ~valueb ~k]: Result from comparing two leaf nodes at
       index [i], with values [valuea] and [valueb].

     - [onlyak ~i ~anode ~k]: Result given that [i]th node [anode] is only
       explicitly present in the first tree argument, [treea].

     - [onlybk ~i ~bnode ~k]: Like [onlyak], mutatis mutandis.

     - [i]: Prefix index of [treea], [treeb] nodes.

     - [treea], [treeb]: The two input trees.
