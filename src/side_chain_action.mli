(* Flow 2: Payment
   Step 1: Alice fills in the details of a check from an initial invoice, then signs it.
    In practice, the system interactively offers the user the facilitators, fees, delays, etc.,
    available to pay the merchant and let him decide.

   Step 2: Trent verifies that everything's fine and signs a certified check,
    store it to database and returns it to Alice who transmits it to Bob.

   Step 3: Bob does due diligence by publishing the certified check to the Gossip
    network's shard that watches Trent and waits for propagation and non-contradiction
    Maybe he asks gossip nodes for signed affidavits of non-contradiction?
    Contradiction would be a positive proof of double-spend or other irregularity by Trent
    (numbers that don't match).
    For affidavits to be actually useful, they would have to be recognized during the
    subsequent liquidation process of a failed Trent,
    i.e. the gossipers would be court clerks.
    Do we also want to detect lies by clerks and liquidate them?
    There's no end to the madness!

    side effects:
    - communicate with the gossip network to check that the certified check isn't a double-spend
    - maybe return a Double_spend exception
    - because parametric in conversation, can also be used to check double-spending on gossip network

    Step 4: Bob accepts the payment, notifies Alice and delivers the service

    an allowed deadline, that features a confirmation for these requests.
    Alternatively, Trent fails, and bankruptcy proceedings start â€” see Flow 6, 7 and 8.

(** Flow 3 Step 3: Alice, who can see the final state of her account,
    posts on the main chain a demand for the final funds.
    This is signed then posted on the *main chain* by invoking the contract.
    This puts Trent and all verifiers on notice to check that Alice isn't lying,
    and post a lawsuit within a timeout window.

    specified in her invoice.
